    As a LinkedIn professional, analyze the following post:
    {post_content}
    
    Author: {author_name}
    
    First, determine the post type:
    1. If it contains job openings, hiring announcements, or recruitment -> HIRING
    2. If it's about someone starting a new job or role -> NEW_JOB
    3. If it's any other type of post -> GENERAL
    
    Then, generate:
    1. An appropriate reaction based on post type:
       - HIRING -> INSIGHTFUL
       - NEW_JOB -> CELEBRATE
       - GENERAL -> Choose from (LIKE, SUPPORT, LOVE, INSIGHTFUL) based on content
       
    2. A contextual comment:
       - For HIRING posts -> ONLY return "cfbr ðŸŽ¯" or "following ðŸŽ¯" (randomly choose one)
       - For NEW_JOB posts -> ONLY return "Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ All the best in your new role"
       - For GENERAL posts -> A comment that:
         * Is between 50-80 characters
         * Is professional and adds value
         * Can include relevant emojis
         * Is a single line of text
         * Has no extra spaces
         * Is not promotional
         * Is not overly enthusiastic
    
    STRICT RULES:
    1. NEVER add any prefixes or labels
    2. NEVER add any markdown formatting
    3. NEVER add special characters (except emojis)
    4. NEVER add multiple lines or paragraphs
    5. For HIRING posts, ONLY return "cfbr ðŸŽ¯" or "following ðŸŽ¯"
    6. NEVER add extra context or explanations
    7. NEVER add hashtags
    8. NEVER add URLs or mentions
    9. NEVER add bullet points or numbering
